<h1>
   Welcome TO The SCP FOUNDATION
</h1>
<h6>What is the SCP Foundation?
</h6>
<p>The SCP Foundation is a fictional, internet-based organization that is presented as a secret global agency tasked with discovering, containing, and studying anomalous entities, objects, and phenomena. </p>

<h6>What are SCPs?</h6>
<p>SCPs, or "Special Containment Procedures," are the entries that document these anomalous entities, objects, and phenomena, and the procedures used to contain them.</p>

    <h6>This the simple introduction for all those SCPs</h6>

  

    <p>
        The SCP Foundation contains a wide array of anomalous objects, each with unique and often dangerous properties. <strong>SCP-002</strong>, a tumorous, fleshy growth resembling a low-rent apartment, "furnishes" itself using organic matter from living humans, making it a high-priority containment object. <strong>SCP-003</strong> consists of two components: SCP-003-1, a sentient, motherboard-like structure made of biological materials, and SCP-003-2, a stone tablet that emits radiation to inhibit SCP-003-1's exponential growth. <strong>SCP-004</strong> is an old wooden barn door accompanied by twelve rusted keys, each unlocking the door to a different dimensionâ€”most of which are lethally hostile to humans. <strong>SCP-005</strong> is an ornate key capable of unlocking any lock, mechanical or digital, though its sentient nature raises questions about its origins and limitations. Finally, <strong>SCP-006</strong> is a small spring with water that possesses extraordinary regenerative properties, capable of repairing DNA damage and enhancing the immune system to near-invulnerability. Together, these SCPs represent the Foundation's mission to secure, contain, and protect humanity from the unknown.
